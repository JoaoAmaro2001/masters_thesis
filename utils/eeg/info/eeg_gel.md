# <center>Gels for EEG

Any conductive gel can be used for EEG studies but some gels are better suited because of their viscosity or the EEG application; for example, in sleep studies it is important to use a gel that takes a long time to dry out. 

## Characteristics:

- Abrasiveness: 
- Opaqueness:
- Clearness: 
- Viscosity:
- Saltiness:

## Specifics

### Dry electrodes

Some EEG caps do not require gel.
